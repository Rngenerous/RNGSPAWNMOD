# RNGS_SPAWN_MOD

Updated spawns for Stay in Tarkov using the build in spawn system. This is still in beta, please report any issues found with this on discord to rngenerous.

There are 2 versions of this, standard and FPS+.

- Standard: Made to feel as close to live as possible.
- FPS+ (Alpha): Should still feel closer to live, but has a number of changes to increase FPS, use this if you are having FPS issues.

Additionally there is a folder for 'vanilla bosses' for each of these where the boss spawns have not been changed.

## Installation

- Backup '<SIT_SERVER_DIR>/Aki_Data/Server/database/locations'
- Copy and paste the contents of 'RNGS_SPAWN_MOD/\<VERSION\>/standard/' into '<SIT_SERVER_DIR>/Aki_Data/Server/database/locations' and override
- Delete the 'jsonCache.json' and 'modCache.json' files in '<SIT_SERVER_DIR>/user/cache'
- Restart the server

## Todo

- Finish FPS+
- Missing folders is because they are not finished yet
